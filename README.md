# My Homework for Coursera's Algorithms 1 Course - Using Ruby
Github: [coursera-algorithms1-ruby](https://github.com/roberttravispierce/coursera-algorithms1-ruby)

## By doing the course in Ruby I'm solving for two desires:
* Learn algorithms in a systematic and comprehensive manner
* Increase my knowledge of Ruby by using it to implement the algorithms. Ruby is my current language of choice and I don't want to get bogged down trying to learn Java for the course homework at this point (The concepts are more than difficult enough by themselves!)

## Let's learn together!
If anyone would like to cooperate with the course and/or solutions, or help with suggestions for improvement please contact me.

## Course Info

About this course: This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms.
